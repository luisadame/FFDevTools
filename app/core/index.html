        <h2>The page inspector</h2>
        <p>
            With the page inspector you can view and change page content and layout. You can get vital information from
            the page visual behaviour such as the box model, animations and grid layouts.
        </p>

            <h4>Examine and edit HTML</h4>
            <p>
                As we open the developer tools the first thing we encounter is the html pane which is positioned on the
                left side of the tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll cover first the outer elements of the pane and then go into the most important element. At the
                bottom we can see the breadcrumbs section from where the hierarchy of an element is displayed.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/Inspector_breadcrumbs.png" alt="Page inspector breadcrumbs">
            <p>Also at the top there is a toolbar with three options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a new node</li>
                    <li>Search the html</li>
                    <li>Grab color from page</li>
                </ul>
                The options are pretty self explained. The "add a new node" button allow us to create a new node in the
                html tree. The "Search the html" gives us the option to look for an element in the html tree. Lastly,
                the "grab a color from the page" is a tool for taking the color of a pixel from the page we are
                inspecting.
            </p>

                The last element is one of the most important for this tool. The <strong>HTML tree</strong> shows the
                elements of a web page and their content. You can edit the html of a site using this tool. For example:
                double clicking on an element makes it editable and we can change that html.
