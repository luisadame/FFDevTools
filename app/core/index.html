        <p>
            With the page inspector you can view and change page content and layout. You can get vital information from
            the page visual behaviour such as the box model, animations and grid layouts.

            <h4>Examine and edit HTML</h4>
            <p>
                As we open the developer tools the first thing we encounter is the html pane which is positioned on the
                left side of the tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll cover first the outer elements of the pane and then go into the most important element. At the
                bottom we can see the breadcrumbs section from where the hierarchy of an element is displayed.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/Inspector_breadcrumbs.png" alt="Page inspector breadcrumbs">
            <p>Also at the top there is a toolbar with three options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Add a new node</li>
                    <li>Search the html</li>
                    <li>Grab color from page</li>
                </ul>
                The options are pretty self explained. The "add a new node" button allow us to create a new node in the
                html tree. The "Search the html" gives us the option to look for an element in the html tree. Lastly,
                the "grab a color from the page" is a tool for taking the color of a pixel from the page we are
                inspecting.
            </p>
            <img src="../assets/img/Inspector_search.png" alt="Page inspector search">
            <p>
                The last element is one of the most important for this tool. The <strong>HTML tree</strong> shows the
                elements of a web page and their content. You can edit the html of a site using this tool. For example:
                double clicking on an element makes it editable and we can change that html.
            </p>

            <p>As shown in the video: first we'll open the firefox dev tools, stay in the inspector tool, and click on
                the tab which is located in the right side panel, named: <i>layout</i>. Then in will appear the box
                model section where you can see the properties of that element that affect the box model. And you'll be
                able to edit them from there just by double clicking de values.</p>

                <code>bottom</code> can use this tool. We'll open the layout tab and click on the icon near the
                position value just under the box model, the page will show us some guides and handlers where the top,
                left, bottom, right have been specified, and we can drag them to move the elements on the page.</p>

        <article id="examine-event-listeners">
            <h4>Examine Event Listeners</h4>
            <p>
                Usually we use javascript to bind some events to html elements, i.e: clicking a button and handle that
                click event with javascript, in order to see if that element or elements have actually a binded event
                we can open the dev tools and look for the event tag at the right side of the node. You can see it in
                action in the video below.
            </p>
            <video muted controls src="../assets/video/examine-event-listeners.mp4"></video>

        <article id="work-with-animations">
            <h4>Work with animations</h4>
            <video controls muted src="../assets/video/animations.mp4"></video>
            <p>
                As you can see in the video, he first thing we can see is that in the css ruels panel there is an
                specification of the keyframes used for the animation. And we can edit the keyframes right there.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right panel there is a detailed visualization of the animation that is being done.
                We can see that first there is a toolbar where there are two buttons for controlling the animation
                playing. We can go back to the firs keyframe or replaying the animation again by pressing the play
                button. Also, we have a selectionof speed to change the animation speed and a timestamp of the current
                time of the animation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we have the graphics, displaying first the node that is being animated and being able to show
                that element on the page. And, on the right side it is shown the animation chart. These charts are
                colored in three different colors depending on which type of animation is: an animation made by a
                <strong>transition property</strong>, using <strong>@keyframes animation</strong>, and finally those
                animations made with the <strong>Web Animations API</strong>. These are colored respectiveley: blue,
                orange, and green.
                These charts are shaped in a way that show how that animation was timed, i.e: if it used an easy
                timing, or different.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, if we click on the animation chart a new panel is gonna be displayed under it, and it will
                show all the animated properties for that animation along with the keyframes points where that property
                is being changed. You can see the value that takes tha property in that moment by hovering it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, in the property names there are some hints about that property performance. If it has a
                lightning icon it means it was controlled by the animation compositor which is much more performant.
                These are related to what events do these properties fire like painting, recalculation and compositing,
                which is something out of the scope.
                However, this tool will inform us about the performance of the animation.

                elements that have a <code>display:grid</code> rule will have a GRID tag on the right of the node

        <h2 id="debugger">The javascript debugger</h2>
        <p>The javascript debugger allows you to step through javascript code to see how it behaves step by step. You
            can set breakpoints to stop the execution in that line. Also, you can add conditional breakpoints, that is
            that if a condition is true then the debugger will stop the execution right there. Furthermore, you can
            step into functions when you are debugging, this is the expected behaviour but sometimes you want to step
            over a function because you know it doesn't contain bugs. </p>
        <p>In this video you can see the full feature set of this tool:</p>
        <video controls src="../assets/video/debugger.mp4"></video>
        <p>In the video before it's explained how to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Set a breakpoint</li>
            <li>Set a conditional breakpoint</li>
            <li>Step over and into the code</li>
            <li>Stop on exceptions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, this is not all, the debugger provides information at any state of the execution, this means that
            when we are stepping through the code we can place the cursor over variables to see their current value.
            For example, in the script shown in the video we can check the value of the <code>counter</code> variable
            hovering it in the code, in this case it will be equals to 4 because we were in the fourth call.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/debugger_hover.png" alt="We can see the that variable counter equals 4 when the cursor it's placed over it">
        <p>If we had placed the cursor over the
            <code>document</code> object we've had seen all of its properties.</p>

        <h2 id="network">The network monitor</h2>
        <p>The network monitor is one of the most important tools regarding optimization. We can see all the documents,
            assets, stylesheets, scripts, fonts, service workers, etc... That are being loaded. It shows their current
            state, for example if an image is being downloaded.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, it shows the best information about a page: its size and time to load.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/page_size_and_time.png" alt="It shows the size and time to load of a web page.">
        <p>You can examine all of the assets that have been loaded or are being downloaded in its main panel, it will

            Here, you can get precios information about the assets loaded. The request status, the method used to get
            the asset, the name of the file, the domain of the file, the type of file (img, script, etc); the cause
            such as websockets, worker, document, etc; the data transferred and the real size and the graphical cascade
            with stages of files being showed (parsed, executed and so). All in all, this is one of the best features
            in developer tools because it allows you to debug assets requests and optimize the load of your web page.
        </p>
        <h3>Filtering</h3>
        <p>Some pages will load up to 50 assets or more, and scrolling through them to find the one we are looking for
            it's a time consuming task. The network monitor offers a solution for this, which is at the top left side
            and it looks like this:</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/network_monitor_filter.png" alt="Filter tool to filter requests">
        <p>However, if you feel like no typing, you can use the options at side which let you filter by document type,
            for example: HTML, CSS, Images, Ajax, etc...</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/network_monitor_document_select.png" alt="Choose the document type you want to filter by">
        <h3>Asset details</h3>
        <p>We've gotten information about the file we want, but we need to know the cookies that are attached to that
            request, how can we know that?</p>
        <p>Well, when we have found our asset we need to click on it and a panel will open on the right side of the
            main panel. It will show more information about that request, for example we can navigate through the tabs
            in that panel, these are: Headers, Cookies, Params, Response, Timings, Stack Trace, and Security.</p>
        <img src="../assets/img/network_monitor_detail_page.png" alt="Request detail panel">
        <h4>Headers</h4>
        <p>
            As you can see in the header tab, there is information about the response headers, for example if we want
            to see the <code>Content-Encoding</code> it will be reflected there. These are the headers attached in the
            response.
            It is included in this panel:
            <ul>
                <li>Request url</li>
                <li>Request method</li>
                <li>Remote ip address and port</li>
                <li>Status code</li>
                <li>The http request and headers sent</li>
                <li>A button to edit and resend the request</li>
                <li>And a raw headers button which will display the raw request and response headers (not formatted)</li>
            </ul>
            Popuplar headers are:
            <table border="1">
                <thead>
                    <td>Name</td>
                    <td>Description</td>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>cache-control</td>
                        <td>This header will inform the browser for how long can this asset be cached until refreshed.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Content-Encoding</td>
                        <td>This will inform the browser which compression algorithm was used to compress the fiel
                            sent.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>content-type</td>
                        <td>This informs the browser with the asset mime type and the browser will use this information
                            to cateogrize the request and parse it correctly.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            There are much more headers that can be seen here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields#Request_fields">List
                of HTTP header fields - wikipedia</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Also, you can examine the headers attached to your request, there it you can see for example your user
            agent which will inform the page you are accessing of the browser that you are using.
        </p>
        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
            As in the headers, we get two panels: the request cookies and response. This is pretty straightforward, we
            get information about the cookies you send to the server requested, and you'll see the cookies sent back
            from the server.
        </p>
        <h4>Params</h4>
        <p>This one is pretty useful if you work with forms, you could see here the parameters sent through a form and
            they'll be displayed nicely there.</p>
        <h4>Response</h4>
        <p>In this section you can see the response sent back from the server, if it is an html page, you can see the
            html code and a little preview, this would work with other files such as images, scripts and more...</p>
        <h4>Timings</h4>
        <p>It will show a little graph with information about the trace of an asset through the network phases, for
            example to retrieve an image from the server there will be these steps:</p>
        <table border="1">
            <thead>
                <td>Name</td>
                <td>Description</td>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Blocked</td>
                    <td>Time spent in a queue waiting for a network connection.

                        The browser imposes a limit on the number of simultaneous connections that can be made to a
                        single server. In Firefox
                        this defaults to 6, but can be changed using the
                        network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server preference. If all
                        connections are in use, the browser can't download more resources until a connection is
                        released.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Dns Resolution</td>
                    <td>Time taken to resolve a host name.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Connecting</td>
                    <td>Time taken to create a TCP connection.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sending</td>
                    <td>Time taken to send the HTTP request to the server.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Waiting</td>
                    <td>Waiting for a response from the server.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Receiving</td>
                    <td>Time taken to read the entire response from the server (or cache).</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h4>Security</h4>
        <p>If the site runs https this will appear on the options and it will show detauls about the connection such as
            the protocol, the cipher and certificate details.</p>
        <h4>Stack trace</h4>
        <p>An stack trace will be shown with information of where the request was initially made.</p>
