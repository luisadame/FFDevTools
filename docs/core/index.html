You can get vital information from the page visual behaviour such as the box model, animations and grid layouts. </p> <img src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/Page_inspector.a4574d04.png" alt="Page inspector screenshot"> <h3>Functionalities</h3> <ul> <li> <a href="#html">Examine and edit HTML</a> </li> <li>Show and edit the box model of an element</li> <li>Inspect and select colors</li> <li>Change the position of elements</li> <li>Edit fonts</li> <li>Visualize transforms</li> <li>Examine and edit CSS</li> <li>Examine event listeners</li> <li>Work with animations</li> <li>Edit CSS filters</li> <li>Edit CSS shapes</li> <li>View background images</li> <li>Use the inspector from the web console</li> <li>Examine CSS grid layouts</li> </ul> <article id="html"> <h4>Examine and edit HTML</h4> <p> As we open the developer tools the first thing we encounter is the html pane which is positioned on the left side of the tools. </p> <p> We'll cover first the outer elements of the pane and then go into the most important element. At the bottom we can see the breadcrumbs section from where the hierarchy of an element is displayed. </p> <img src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/Inspector_breadcrumbs.a993d9e2.png" alt="Page inspector breadcrumbs"> <p>Also at the top there is a toolbar with three options: <ul> <li>Add a new node</li> <li>Search the html</li> <li>Grab color from page</li> </ul> The options are pretty self explained. The "add a new node" button allow us to create a new node in the html tree. The "Search the html" gives us the option to look for an element in the html tree. Lastly, the "grab a color from the page" is a tool for taking the color of a pixel from the page we are inspecting. </p> <img src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/Inspector_search.f9e52285.png" alt="Page inspector search"> <p> The last element is one of the most important for this tool. The <strong>HTML tree</strong> shows the elements of a web page and their content. You can edit the html of a site using this tool. For example: double clicking on an element makes it editable and we can change that html. </p> <img src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/Inspector_html_tree.0a9f031e.png" alt="Page inspector's html tree"> </article> </section> <section> <h2 id="debugger">The javascript debugger</h2> <p>The javascript debugger allows you to step through javascript code to see how it behaves step by step. You can set breakpoints to stop the execution in that line. Also, you can add conditional breakpoints, that is that if a condition is true then the debugger will stop the execution right there. Furthermore, you can step into functions when you are debugging, this is the expected behaviour but sometimes you want to step over a function because you know it doesn't contain bugs. </p> <p>In this video you can see the full feature set of this tool:</p> <video controls src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/debugger.616076d3.mp4"></video> <p>In the video before it's explained how to:</p> <ul> <li>Set a breakpoint</li> <li>Set a conditional breakpoint</li> <li>Step over and into the code</li> <li>Stop on exceptions</li> </ul> <p>However, this is not all, the debugger provides information at any state of the execution, this means that when we are stepping through the code we can place the cursor over variables to see their current value. For example, in the script shown in the video we can check the value of the <code>counter</code> variable hovering it in the code, in this case it will be equals to 4 because we were in the fourth call.</p> <img src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/debugger_hover.b2b8f1aa.png" alt="We can see the that variable counter equals 4 when the cursor it's placed over it"> <p>If we had placed the cursor over the <code>document</code> object we've had seen all of its properties.</p> </section> <section> <h2 id="network">The network monitor</h2> <p>The network monitor is one of the most important tools regarding optimization. We can see all the documents, assets, stylesheets, scripts, fonts, service workers, etc... That are being loaded. It shows their current state, for example if an image is being downloaded.</p> <p>Furthermore, it shows the best information about a page: its size and time to load.</p> <img src="https://mrluissan.github.io/FFDevTools/page_size_and_time.70b8ca9d.png" alt="It shows the size and time to load of a web page."> </section> </body> </html>
